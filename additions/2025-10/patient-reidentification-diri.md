# Adversarial re-identification on de-identified clinical text (DIRI)

**Why it matters (impact)**  
Demonstrates that LLMs can facilitate adversarial re-identification against de-identified notes, challenging naïve assumptions about text anonymization when models infer latent identifiers.

**OWASP LLM Top-10 mapping**  
- LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure  
- LLM02: Insecure Output Handling

**Mitigations**  
- Layered de-identification (rule-based + ML) plus risk-based release; red-teaming with re-identification probes before data sharing.  
- Minimize model access to longitudinal context unless essential; apply privacy-attacks testing in ML governance.
