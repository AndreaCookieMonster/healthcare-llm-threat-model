# Prompt injection on surgical video VLMs

**Why it matters (impact)**  
In laparoscopic/surgical video decision support, time-varying visual/textual overlays can collapse model accuracy (e.g., full-duration injections dropped accuracy dramatically). This is a realistic theatre-side risk where video overlays (from devices or third-party sources) are present.

- LLM01: Prompt Injection  
- LLM02: Insecure Output Handling

**Mitigations**  
- Block text overlays in OR video feeds; apply overlay-scrub filters and OCR-based overlay detectors before inference.  
- Temporal consistency checks; abstain/alert on injection suspicion.  
- Separate clinical UI from raw model text; require clin-review approvals.
